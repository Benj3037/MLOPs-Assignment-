## Objectives:
This repository contains all notebooks and local datafiles for the final assignment in the module data engineering and machine learning operations in business (*"MLOPs" in short*)

The objective of this assignment is to build a prediction system that predicts the electricity prices in Denmark based on weather conditions, previous prices, and the Danish holidays.

## Structure:
There are four notebooks in the folder "*notebooks*":

1. **Feature Backfill**: Data is loaded and we engineer and create feature groups.
2. **Feature Pipeline**: New data are parsed and inserted into feature groups.
3. **Training Pipeline**: Building feature view,  training dataset split, training a model, and saving it in the Model Registry.
4. **Inference Pipeline**: The trained model is retrieved from the model registry and used for batch inference.

### Feature Backfill
The data is loaded from three different API's, 

### Feature Pipeline

### Training Pipeline

### Inference Pipeline

## Data:
The data used comes from three different sources:

- Electricity prices in Denmark per day from [Energinet](https://www.energidataservice.dk).
- Different meteorological observations from [Open meteo](https://www.open-meteo.com).
- Danish Calendar with the type if the date is a national holiday or not. This file is made manually by the group and is located in the "*data*" folder inside this repository.

See corresponding functions in the folder [features](https://github.com/Camillahannesbo/MLOPs-Assignment-/tree/main/features).
