# Topic title: Electricity Price Predicter for Denmark DK1 
## Business Problem
In recent times, energy prices have experienced a notable surge, prompting consumers and businesses alike to scrutinize their energy consumption patterns more closely than ever before. This surge in energy prices has not only heightened awareness regarding energy usage but has also sparked a renewed interest in identifying the optimal times for energy consumption. As consumers seek to navigate this landscape of rising energy costs, understanding when the best times are for utilizing energy becomes paramount. By pinpointing these optimal periods, individuals and organizations can strategically adjust their energy usage patterns to minimize costs while maximizing efficiency.

### Objectives
The objective is to build a prediction system that predicts the electricity prices in Denmark (area DK1) based on weather conditions, previous prices, and the Danish holidays. This will end up in an frontend application there ultimately can help the user decide when is the best time to charge the electric vehicle or have production running - leading to potential cost savings or profit maximization. 
The application can be relevent both individual client and in larger business perspective.
